              Core provides basic functionality to layout and query the

              profiles, phenotypes, and other molecular states; and to link the
              network to databases of functional annotations. The Core is
              extensible through a straightforward plug-in architecture,

              among this set can sometimes point to the function of the gene.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Gene-set enrichment analysis is a useful technique to
              help functionally characterize large gene lists, such as the
              results of gene expression experiments. This technique finds
              functionally coherent gene-sets, such as pathways, that are
              statistically over-represented in a given gene list. Ideally, the
              number of resulting sets is smaller than the number of genes in
              the list, thus simplifying interpretation. However, the
              increasing number and redundancy of gene-sets used by many
              current enrichment analysis software works against this ideal.
              PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To overcome gene-set redundancy and help in
              the interpretation of large gene lists, we developed ``Enrichment
              Map'', a network-based visualization method for gene-set
              enrichment results. Gene-sets are organized in a network, where
              each set is a node and edges represent gene overlap between sets.
              Automated network layout groups related gene-sets into network
              clusters, enabling the user to quickly identify the major
              enriched functional themes and more easily interpret the
              enrichment results. CONCLUSIONS: Enrichment Map is a significant
              advance in the interpretation of enrichment analysis. Any
              research project that generates a list of genes can take
              advantage of this visualization framework. Enrichment Map is
              implemented as a freely available and user friendly plug-in for
              the Cytoscape network visualization software

	Abstract = {Networks often contain regions of tightly connected nodes, or clusters, that highlight their shared relationships. An effective way to create a visual summary of a network is to identify clusters and annotate them with an enclosing shape and a summarizing label. Cytoscape provides the ability to annotate a network with shapes and labels, however these annotations must be created manually one at a time, which can be a laborious process. AutoAnnotate is a Cytoscape 3 App that automates the process of identifying clusters and visually annotating them. It greatly reduces the time and effort required to fully annotate clusters in a network, and provides freedom to experiment with different strategies for identifying and labelling clusters. Many customization options are available that enable the user to refine the generated annotations as required. Annotated clusters may be collapsed into single nodes using the Cytoscape groups feature, which helps simplify a network by making its overall structure more visible. AutoAnnotate is applicable to any type of network, including enrichment maps, protein-protein interactions, pathways, or social networks.},
